## About
s.RunnerManager is a wrapper and manager for Github Actions Runners which uses the docker image from [myoung34](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner).

With s.RunnerManager it is possible to automatically create and delete runners as required. In addition, the runners are reset after each run, which means that the runners are equivalent to those provided by Github.
